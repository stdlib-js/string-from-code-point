    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
import fromCodePoint from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/string-from-code-point@esm/index.mjs';
```
The previous example will load the latest bundled code from the esm branch. Alternatively, you may load a specific version by loading the file from one of the [tagged bundles](https://github.com/stdlib-js/string-from-code-point/tags). For example,

```javascript
import fromCodePoint from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/string-from-code-point@v0.2.0-esm/index.mjs';
```

#### fromCodePoint( pt1\[, pt2\[, pt3\[, ...]]] )

Creates a `string` from a sequence of Unicode [code points][code-point].

```javascript
var out = fromCodePoint( 9731 );
// returns 'â˜ƒ'
```

In addition to providing [code points][code-point] as separate arguments, the function supports providing an array-like `object` as a single argument containing a sequence of [code points][code-point].

```javascript
import Uint16Array from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/array-uint16@esm/index.mjs';

var out = fromCodePoint( 97, 98, 99 );
// returns 'abc'

out = fromCodePoint( new Uint16Array( [ 97, 98, 99 ] ) );
// returns 'abc'
```

## Notes

-   This function differs from [`String.fromCharCode`][mdn-string-fromcharcode] in the following ways:

    -   The function provides support for all valid Unicode values (up to `21` bits). While most common Unicode values can be represented using one 16-bit unit, higher code point characters require two 16-bit units (a surrogate pair consisting of a high and a low surrogate) to form a single character. [`String.fromCharCode`][mdn-string-fromcharcode] does **not** support surrogate pairs, supporting only UCS-2, a subset of [UTF-16][utf-16].

-   This function differs from [`String.fromCodePoint`][mdn-string-fromcodepoint] in the following ways:

    -   The function supports explicitly providing an array-like `object` containing a sequence of [code points][code-point].
    -   The function requires **at least** one [code point][code-point].
    -   The function requires that all [code points][code-point] be nonnegative integers. The function does **not** support values, such as `null`, `undefined`, `true`, `false`, `'0'`, `'1'`, etc., which can be cast to integer values.
