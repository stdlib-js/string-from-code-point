## Usage

```javascript
import fromCodePoint from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/string-from-code-point@deno/mod.js';
```

#### fromCodePoint( pt1\[, pt2\[, pt3\[, ...]]] )

Creates a `string` from a sequence of Unicode [code points][code-point].

```javascript
var out = fromCodePoint( 9731 );
// returns 'â˜ƒ'
```

In addition to providing [code points][code-point] as separate arguments, the function supports providing an array-like `object` as a single argument containing a sequence of [code points][code-point].

```javascript
import Uint16Array from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/array-uint16@deno/mod.js';

var out = fromCodePoint( 97, 98, 99 );
// returns 'abc'

out = fromCodePoint( new Uint16Array( [ 97, 98, 99 ] ) );
// returns 'abc'
```

## Notes

-   This function differs from [`String.fromCharCode`][mdn-string-fromcharcode] in the following ways:

    -   The function provides support for all valid Unicode values (up to `21` bits). While most common Unicode values can be represented using one 16-bit unit, higher code point characters require two 16-bit units (a surrogate pair consisting of a high and a low surrogate) to form a single character. [`String.fromCharCode`][mdn-string-fromcharcode] does **not** support surrogate pairs, supporting only UCS-2, a subset of [UTF-16][utf-16].

-   This function differs from [`String.fromCodePoint`][mdn-string-fromcodepoint] in the following ways:

    -   The function supports explicitly providing an array-like `object` containing a sequence of [code points][code-point].
    -   The function requires **at least** one [code point][code-point].
    -   The function requires that all [code points][code-point] be nonnegative integers. The function does **not** support values, such as `null`, `undefined`, `true`, `false`, `'0'`, `'1'`, etc., which can be cast to integer values.
